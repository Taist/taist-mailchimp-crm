The addon allows to add Zoho Contact to Mailchimp lists directly from its page.

Setting up the addon:
---------------------
On Mailchimp account settings page, go to "Extras -> API keys"; if you don't have an API key yet, just create it; you will see a link "Enable Zoho CRM integration" near each API key you have - press it near the key you would like to use.

Using the addon:
----------------
1. Open a Contact in Zoho
2. Scroll down - you will see new Mailchimp block below "Campaigns" block
3. Put / remove ticks to manage mailchimp lists for the contact
